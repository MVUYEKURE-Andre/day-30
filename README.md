# Day 30 - Exception Handling

My 100 days of code challenge - Day 30 focuses on Exception Handling in Python.

## Project Overview

This day covers exception handling with try/except/else/finally blocks. The project includes:

1. **exception_examples.py** - Demonstrates various exception handling techniques
2. **main.py** - Command-line password manager with exception handling
3. **password_manager.py** - GUI-based password manager (requires tkinter)

## Key Concepts Covered

- `try/except` blocks for catching exceptions
- `try/except/else` for code that runs when no exception occurs
- `try/except/finally` for cleanup code that always runs
- Handling multiple exception types
- Raising custom exceptions
- `FileNotFoundError`, `KeyError`, `ValueError`, `ZeroDivisionError`, `TypeError`

## How to Run

### Exception Examples
```bash
python exception_examples.py
```

### Command-Line Password Manager
```bash
python main.py
```

### GUI Password Manager (requires tkinter)
```bash
python password_manager.py
```

## What I Learned

- How to use try/except blocks to handle errors gracefully
- The difference between except, else, and finally clauses
- How to catch specific exception types
- How to raise custom exceptions
- Best practices for exception handling in Python
